# What is it?
This is a (currently untested) configuration file for [KrakenD](https://github.com/devopsfaith/krakend-ce).

It is intended as an API gateway overlay for the WordPress API to facilitate decomposition when trying to better 
architect a heavily plugin driven and growing WordPress based application.

The basic version here is a direct endpoint-to-endpoint proxy, for you to replace/extend as and when necessary on an
endpoint-by-endpoint basis.
